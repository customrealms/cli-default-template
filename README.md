# cli-default-template

This is the default template project installed when running `crx init` using the CustomRealms CLI.

Do not clone this repo as a starting point for a new project, as it will not work. Instead, you need to install the CustomRealms CLI and run `crx init`, which will properly initialize a project using this repo as a template.
